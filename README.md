# ESP32 Wi-Fi Remote Motor Controller

This project lets you wirelessly control a motor using an ESP32, MD10C motor driver, and a custom RemoteXY interface. Built for testing and demonstration of Wi-Fi-based remote control systems.

## Features

- Wi-Fi-based motor control
- RemoteXY GUI for easy interfacing
- Supports direction and speed control
- Custom motor driver logic (MD10C)
- Real-time wireless communication

## Hardware Used

- ESP32 (e.g., DevKit V1)
- Cytron MD10C motor driver
- DC motor
- Power supply
- Optional: battery, chassis, encoder

## Software Used

- [RemoteXY](https://remotexy.com/)
- PlatformIO / Arduino IDE
- ESP32 Wi-Fi libraries

## RemoteXY GUI Layout

ðŸ•¹ RemoteXY Control Modes
This ESP32 robot is controlled via RemoteXY WiFi GUI, where the text field (edit_1) is used to switch between control modes, and four buttons perform different actions depending on the selected mode.

Mode (edit_1)	button_01	button_02	button_03	button_04
move	Move Forward	Move Backward	Decrease Speed	Increase Speed
spot	Spot Turn CW	Spot Turn CCW	Side Shift Left	Side Shift Right
acer	Accelerate FWD	Accelerate REV	Steer Left	Steer Right
backacer	Accelerate FWD	Accelerate REV	Rear Steer Left	Rear Steer Right
holomonic	Move Forward	Move Backward	Strafe Left (lateral)	Strafe Right (lateral)
frs	Increase Speed	Decrease Speed	Rotate Left (FR motor)	Rotate Right (FR motor)
fls	Increase Speed	Decrease Speed	Rotate Left (FL motor)	Rotate Right (FL motor)
brs	Increase Speed	Decrease Speed	Rotate Left (BR motor)	Rotate Right (BR motor)
bls	Increase Speed	Decrease Speed	Rotate Left (BL motor)	Rotate Right (BL motor)

ðŸ”§ How to Use
Connect to ESP32 WiFi named: classic

Open the RemoteXY app with the preconfigured GUI.

In the text field, enter a mode keyword like:

move

acer

holomonic

Use the 4 buttons to perform actions listed above.

## How It Works

1. Connect ESP32 to MD10C.
2. Load firmware using PlatformIO.
3. ESP32 connects to your Wi-Fi or becomes an access point.
4. Use the RemoteXY mobile app to control the motor wirelessly.
